# Hangman
Simple Hangman game in C#

This code uses an array of words from which one word is randomly chosen. Then, a hidden word is created, where each letter is replaced by an underscore. 
The player has 10 attempts to guess the word. In each attempt, the player enters a letter, and the program checks if the letter appears in the chosen word. 
If the letter is correct, it replaces the corresponding underscore in the hidden word. 
If the letter is incorrect, the player loses one attempt. 
The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
